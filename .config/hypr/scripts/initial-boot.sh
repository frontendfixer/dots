# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE DELETED ONCE SUCCESSFULLY BOOTED!! And also, edit ~/.config/hypr/configs/Settings.conf
# NOT necessary to do since this script is only designed to run only once as long as the marker exists
# marker file is located at ~/.config/hypr/.initial_startup_done
# However, I do highly suggest not to touch it since again, as long as the marker exist, script wont run
